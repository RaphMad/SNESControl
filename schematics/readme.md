Some tips:

* The project is based on an Arduino Uno, but any Arduino should work (as long as the pin numbers are matching).
* I used a breadboard to prototype this project.
* For interfacing with the console / controller I cut a SNES cable in half and soldered breadboard connections pins to the individual wires.
